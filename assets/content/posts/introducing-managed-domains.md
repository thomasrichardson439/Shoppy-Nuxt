To compliment our newest feature, custom domains, we decided to add an even easier way with absolutely ZERO setup required to get your custom domain running!

### Introducing Managed Domains

From now on you can purchase a managed domain in your storefront domain list in order to get a new custom domain running and automatically linked to your shop.

When adding a new domain to your storefront domains you will now see a type selector where you can choose "Managed" and purchase a domain, simply type a domain or a name you are interested in and press the search button, resulting in a list of available domains you can purchase.

There are no additional details required from you as we care about your privacy.

As of now the only supported purchase gateway is using Bitcoin, we look forward to adding more supported gateways in the future.
