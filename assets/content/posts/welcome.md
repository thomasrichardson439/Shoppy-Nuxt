Today we are glad to announce the new future of Shoppy with the upcoming updates we've prepared for you,
We are excited to finally share our progress with you and we're working hard and as always, dedicated to provide our customers with the best e-commerce experience possible.

These past years have taught us alot about the e-commerce industry, your feedback was and is essential for our growth, so we would like to thank everyone that submits feature requests, UI/UX improvements and ideas, and of course, bug and security concerns.

In our attempts to become more transparent with our customers, we have officially launched our new blog where we will post technical related challenges we stumble across, feature updates and things to look for in the future.

## Introducing, Storefront

### Personalized Domains

Choose a selection of domains from which your shop can be accessed from. (with more to come in the near future)

```

From now on your shop is accessible from any of these domains at any time.
Example: `myshop.shoppy.services` will now open the equivalent of `shoppy.gg/@myshop`
