We're sorry to hear that your purchase requires a refund.

Unfortunately, Shoppy is unable to provide assistance with refunds as all payments go directly to the seller and therefore Shoppy does not hold/escrow payments and all products are seller controlled.

If the payment was made via PayPal or Stripe, you'll be able to create a dispute on their platforms. Before escalating the situation, we recommend you first contact the seller and attempt to come to a solution.
